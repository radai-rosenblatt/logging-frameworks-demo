# Java Logging Frameworks Demo

Java has (at least?) 5 commonly-used logging APIs:

1. log4j 2.0
2. log4j 1.2
3. slf4j (with logback being the canonical backing implementation)
4. java.util.logging (aka jul)
5. apache commons logging (previously jakarta commons logging aka jcl)


This project is intended to demonstrate how to redirect the logging output
of all of those onto a single logging framework of choice (for logj2 and slf4j/logback)
